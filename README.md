# Minitalk

## Introduction
This project is a tiny project made during my first year.
I was proud of it :-)
But unfortunatly, I made a mistake when I wanted to rename a folder from serveur to server : I forgot to add it again with 'git add' (actually whith the equivalent in svn )
So I got a bad mark ...

## compile it
First of all, I thinl the final prject is in the folder called minitalk

The others are saves from previous version I made

And tpminitalk folder is the workshop done during the class (I keep it and the exec file too I got trap in it :-p )
